# requirements.txt for the Word Cloud Generation Service

# Core web framework
Flask

# Word cloud generation library
wordcloud

# Chinese text segmentation library (required for language='zh')
jieba

# Image processing library (often required by wordcloud for saving images)
Pillow

# --- Optional: For Production Deployment ---

gunicorn


# === Notes ===
# 1. This file lists the direct dependencies. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.
# 2. For reproducible builds (recommended for production), freeze the exact versions
#    in your working environment using: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
#    This will add version numbers (e.g., Flask==2.1.2).
# 3. Ensure the NLTK data ('punkt', 'stopwords') is downloaded in the deployment environment
#    if you rely on NLTK's functionality.
